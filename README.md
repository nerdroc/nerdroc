I have been developing web-based applications with Django and PostgreSQL for the past 3 years.  

I know how to organize development from client requirements to production deployment and can adapt to anything given enough time for the learning curve.  






I have: 
  - Strong practical knowledge of RESTAPI built with Django Rest Framework.  
  - Solid experience with Django web application 
  - Experience creating a beautiful and straightforward User Interface with React, Redux, Bootstrap. 
  - Daily usage of Version Control such as Git and a good understanding of Object-Oriented Principles.   
  
Skills: 
  - Back end : Python, Django, Django Rest Framework  
  - Front end : HTML & CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6), Bootstrap (v3, v4) React, Redux, React Native 
  - Database : PostgreSQL
  - Others: C++, Git, Linux CLI, Heroku, Docker, Travis CI   
  
I am detail-oriented, but even more client-oriented, thatâ€™s why I am always trying to find the best possible solution for any issue. 
I use best software practices and take pride in writing code that is maintainable and performs well.
